# MOS6502-Multi-M6502
 6502 Cpu emulator coded in 32 bit assembly by Neil Bradley.
 
This 6502 Cpu emulator was coded in 32 bit assembly by Neil Bradley, which was originally used in NESticle 0.2x and 0.3x, and other emulators for NES, some arcade systems and anything else that uses the 6502 cpu. It is a very optimized emulator, and can run Asteroids, for example, at 9-10 times its actual speed on a P60.

Compile make6502.c, generate the source to M6502 by running it, and assemble with NASM 0.95+.
